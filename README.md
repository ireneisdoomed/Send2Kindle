Send2Kindle is a small application to automate the process of uploading an ebook to your Kindle.

This tool takes advantage of the function of [sending documents to your Kindle](https://www.amazon.com/-/es/gp/sendtokindle/email) as an email attachment provided by Amazon.

You can see a good description of how it works in this [Youtube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bkfoBYNJjIw) (in Spanish).

foobar.pluralize('word') # returns 'words'
